This repository contains my personal DSA notes written in C, created purely for my own exam preparation. It organizes every topic in a simple, clear, and syllabus‑aligned format, including explanations, code snippets, and quick revision points for fast learning. The goal is to keep all important concepts—arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, searching, sorting, recursion, and more—in one place so I can revise efficiently and strengthen my understanding before exams.
